The simulation was run for a 25 by 25 lattice and a 19 by 31 lattice. The simulation for these two lattices was run for densities of .1 to .8 and .05 intervals. For each density, five simulations where taken. Their averages were plotted into the two barplots included.       On the 25 by 25 lattice, I found that the traffic flowed freely on densities of r <= .4. Densities higher than .4 tended to create traffic jams in fewer and fewer timesteps. On the 19 by 31 lattice, I found that the traffic flowed freely on densities of r <= .5. Densities higher than .5 tended to create traffic jams in fewer and fewer timesteps. For both observations, higher densities meant that it takes fewer timesteps on average to reach gridlock. Also irregular lattices like 19 by 31, I think will allow for higher densities without causing gridlock.
